1. Overview
This project is designed to track new buyers of a specific cryptocurrency token on the Solana blockchain. It identifies first-time Solana buyers who purchase the token and notifies users in real time. This system can help investors analyze market trends and predict buying patterns for better trading decisions.

2. Problem Statement

  (a) In the crypto market, whale and new investor movements can significantly impact token prices. Investors want to track:
  (b) New wallets buying the token for the first time.
  (c) Remaining Solana (SOL) balance in the wallet after purchase (indicating further possible buys).
  (d) Historical purchase trends of these buyers.
  (e) Real-time alerts when such purchases occur.
  (f) By tracking new token buyers, traders can identify potential growth trends and predict future price movements.

3. System Components & Workflow
  A. Data Collection - Fetching Blockchain Transactions
    (a) Connect to Solana blockchain using an API service (Helius or Solscan API).
    (b) Fetch recent transactions related to the target token address.
    (c) Identify transactions where a new buyer purchases the token for the first time.
    (d) Extract wallet address, token purchase amount, and remaining SOL balance.

B. Data Storage - Storing Buyer Information
  (a) Use PostgreSQL (or MongoDB) to store transaction details.
  (b) Ensure that duplicate buyers are not re-added.
  (c) Store timestamps, wallet addresses, and token balances for analysis.

C. Notification System - Real-Time Alerts
  (a) Send Telegram/Discord alerts when a new buyer is detected.
  (b) The alert includes wallet address, purchase amount, and remaining SOL.

D. API Endpoint - Accessing Buyer Data
  (1) A Flask-based REST API allows querying the database for buyer records.
  (2) This enables integration with a web dashboard or trading system.

4. Project Implementation
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
      We use Python for backend logic and SQL for data storage.

           pip install requests python-dotenv psycopg2 flask

Step 2: Fetch Token Transactions from Solana
     We use an API service to fetch blockchain transaction data.

-> Code to Fetch Transactions

import requests
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
SOLANA_API_KEY = os.getenv("SOLANA_API_KEY")

def get_transactions(token_address):
    url = f"https://api.helius.xyz/v0/addresses/{token_address}/transactions?api-key={SOLANA_API_KEY}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else None

token_address = "YourTokenAddressHere"
transactions = get_transactions(token_address)
print(transactions)

 -> Explanation
   (1) Fetches transactions for the target token address.
   (2) Returns JSON response with transaction details.
   (3) Can be expanded to filter transactions based on buyer activity.

Step 3: Identify First-Time Buyers
      We need to check if the buyer has transacted before.

-> Code to Check First-Time Buyers
def is_first_time_buyer(wallet_address):
    url = f"https://api.helius.xyz/v0/addresses/{wallet_address}/transactions?api-key={SOLANA_API_KEY}"
    response = requests.get(url).json()
    return len(response) == 1  # Only one transaction means it's their first purchase

wallet_address = "NewBuyerWallet"
if is_first_time_buyer(wallet_address):
    print(f"ðŸš€ New Buyer Detected: {wallet_address}")

 -> Explanation
   (1) Fetches all past transactions of the wallet.
   (2) If the wallet has only one transaction, it is a new buyer.
   (3) Step 4: Store Buyer Data in PostgreSQL

   (4) We store wallet addresses, token purchases, and balances for future analysis.

-> Database Setup
   import psycopg2

    conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname="crypto_tracker",
    user="your_user",
    password="your_password",
    host="localhost"
   )

  cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS buyers (
    wallet_address TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    token_address TEXT,
    solana_balance FLOAT,
    first_purchase_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
""")

  conn.commit()

 -> Code to Add New Buyers

def add_new_buyer(wallet_address, token_address, balance):
    cur.execute(
        "INSERT INTO buyers (wallet_address, token_address, solana_balance) VALUES (%s, %s, %s) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING",
        (wallet_address, token_address, balance)
    )
    conn.commit()

add_new_buyer("NewWallet", "YourTokenAddress", 20)

-> Explanation
   (1) The buyerâ€™s wallet address, token, and SOL balance are stored.
   (2) Avoids duplicate records using ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING.

Step 5: Send Telegram Alerts for New Buyers
     We send real-time notifications when a new buyer is detected.

-> Code for Telegram Alert
   import requests

   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "your_telegram_bot_token"
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "your_chat_id"

    def send_telegram_alert(wallet_address, balance):
     message = f"ðŸš€ New Buyer Alert!\nWallet: {wallet_address}\nRemaining SOL: {balance} SOL"
     url = f"https://api.telegram.org/bot{TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/sendMessage"
     data = {"chat_id": TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID, "text": message}
     requests.post(url, data=data)

   send_telegram_alert("NewBuyerWallet", 20)

 -> Explanation
   (1) Uses Telegram API to send alerts.
   (2) The alert contains the buyerâ€™s wallet and remaining SOL balance.

   Step 6: Create API to Fetch Buyer Data
  A Flask-based API allows querying buyer data.

-> Flask API Code
  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/buyers', methods=['GET'])
  def get_buyers():
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM buyers")
    buyers = cur.fetchall()
    return jsonify(buyers)

  if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

 -> Explanation
   (1) Provides a REST API to access stored buyer data.
   (2) Can be used for web dashboards or trading bots.

5. How the System Works
   (a) Monitor blockchain transactions for the target token.
   (b) Check if the buyer is new (first-time Solana user).
   (c) Store buyer details in a database.
   (d) Send alerts when a new buyer is detected.
   (e) Provide an API to access buyer data.

6. Future Enhancements
  (a) Web Dashboard: Display buyer trends using React.js or Next.js.
  (b) AI-Based Predictions: Predict future buy trends using machine learning.
  (c) Automated Trading Bot: Execute trades based on new buyer data.
  (d) Multi-Blockchain Support: Extend tracking to Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon.

8. Conclusion
This project helps traders analyze market trends by tracking first-time buyers. The automation of data collection, notifications, and storage enables real-time insights for better trading decisions.
